The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

    "##### SRS over Stratified Sampling\n",
    "SRS is the theoretically ideal random sampling method, given that any individual in the population is as likely to be selected as any other; it doesn't introduce any bias at all. Stratified sampling, as applied in this projects, is systematically biassed, given that all postcodes have the same probability of being selected, regardless of how many businesses they have, which favours businesses in \"small\" postcodes, and, hence, the sample distribution is very likely to differ from the population distribution if there are systematic differentces between restaurants depending on their postcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stratified Sampling over Cluster Sampling\n",
    "The main advantage of stratified sampling, as applied in this project, over cluster sampling, is that all postcodes will be represented in any sample, including postcodes with relatively very few restaurants, whereas cluster sampling has the exact opposite effect, most postcodes will be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why consider performing one sampling method over another?\n",
    "Everything else being equal, SRS is most likely to produce a sample that resembles the population. However, it has the most complicated logistics if, say, it involves on-site visits, and may not be practical in terms of time and expenses for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified sampling has the advantage that it guarantees that individuals of every group of interest will be represented in the sample, if this is a concern. However, it has the same drawback as SRS, and can be biased, as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster sampling overcomes the other methods' main drawback, given that travel would be restricted to just a few areas. However, it guarantees that most areas will be excluded from the sample, so if different postcode distributions are all very different then the sample distribution might not be representative of the population as a whole."

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
